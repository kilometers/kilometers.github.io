<hr>
<p>Have you heard of Heroku? Openshift? “Cloud application&nbsp;platforms”?</p>
<p>In short, scalable hosting has become a big concern for app developers.
After all, if you’re expecting to create the next Facebook, you sure as hell
want to know that your server can handle unexpected growth overnight. You’ve
heard the stories of this or that website finding itself in the spotlight, only 
to miss its opportunity when overwhelmed and shutdown by a deluge of unexpected&nbsp;traffic.</p>
<p>That’s what application platforms like Heroku and Openshift aim to prevent. 
You click a few buttons, they wave a magic wand, and &gt;<span class="caps">POOF</span>&lt; your website’s 
faster, stronger, built to last longer. The solutions of yesteryear would 
have involved calling your hosting company, setting up an enterprise level 
server, migrating the site, debugging, etc. This meant more $$$, and it didn’t 
grade nicely from Mom’s-basement-programmer to succesful Silicon-Shiny&nbsp;start-up.</p>
<p>Until&nbsp;now…</p>

<p>A key part of Heroku <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Openshift’s business models are their Tier 0 “Free” servers. 
If I have an idea for an app, as soon as I’ve completed a prototype I can have it
running on Heroku or Openshift in minutes. Not only does this help me bring an
idea to market sooner, it also sucks me into the companies’ ecosystems. Their gamble is
simple: Give away server time to developers, get the next Twitter, Facebook, or Wikipedia 
paying them for hosting. Clients like those are lucrative and worth the free
servers Heroku and Openshift&nbsp;offer.</p>
<p>But what if I’m not looking to make a killer app, and instead I just want to host this&nbsp;blog?</p>
<p>With older blog frameworks like Wordpress, these Tier 0 servers are untenable. 
<span class="caps">WP</span> and others rely heavily on databases to store their data, and database access is 
an expensive task for the server as it involves relatively large amounts of CPU, memory,
and storage. Good news, however! Most blogs don’t actually need that kind of power. 
Wordpress is a wonderful way to manage a ton of content, like a company site or store, 
but if you’re a simple blogger looking to share simple words and images, there’s something
called a “static blog”. Static blogs don’t use a database. Their information is hard-coded,
and is regenerated everytime you make a change to the site (and that only takes a few seconds).
It makes your site load faster, and it opens up the possibility of “free” hosting on
Heroku or&nbsp;Openshift.</p>
<p>It may seem a bit backward, as it feels like we’ve been fighting and clawing our way from
static content for over a decade. The thing is, it’s not. It’s very clever. It’s spartan.
It’s smart. For most people, it really is all that you need, and it doesn’t feel “static”.
Best of all. It’s&nbsp;free.</p>
