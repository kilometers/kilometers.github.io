With a few lines of code, you can quickly reformat large data sets or locate impossibly
well hidden text. If you haven’t taught yourself Regex, do yourself a favor. I’ll help get
you started. First though, get a text editor that supports Regex. I like Notepad++.
If you want to use something else, that’s&nbsp;fine.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s our mis-formatted&nbsp;data:</p>
<pre><code>Sophia,F,22158
Emma,F,20791
Isabella,F,18931
</code></pre><p>They’re the top 3 girls names in the <span class="caps">US</span> in 2012 (according to social security&nbsp;applications)</p>
<p>Okay, so it’s not mis-formatted. The data looks okay, visually. But if you’re going to use this in a web app,
you’ll want something with more meta-information. Ideally you’d have this data in a format
such as <span class="caps">JSON</span> or XML. It might be easy enough to manually convert these three lines, but the file they
came from has thousands of entries. And that’s just for the year 2012. The whole data set
goes back to the late 1800’s. Have fun manually formatting +7 megabytes of&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Regex is your friend&nbsp;here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open a new file in Notepad++ and paste the data from above. In the menu, go to Search &gt;&nbsp;Replace…</p>
</li>
<li><p>A new window should open with two fields: “Find what” and “Replace&nbsp;with”</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the “Find what” field, enter <code>(.&#42;),(.),([0-9]&#42;)</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>In the “Replace with” field, enter <code>{\n\t”name”: “$1”,\n\t”sex”: “$2”,\n\t”total”: $3\n},</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click “Replace&nbsp;All”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should now see&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "name": "Sophia",
    "sex": "F",
    "total": 22158
},
{
    "name": "Emma",
    "sex": "F",
    "total": 20791
},
{
    "name": "Isabella",
    "sex": "F",
    "total": 18931
},
</code></pre>

<p>Viola! You’ve just saved yourself a visit to the asylum. However, before you still end up there
out of sheer confusion regarding what you just did, let me&nbsp;explain.</p>
<p>To reformat the data, you must first find it intelligently. Regex are symbols that can help
target a search, and then some. Let’s start with looking at what the original data was made&nbsp;of:</p>
<pre><code>Sophia,F,22158
</code></pre><p>In each entry, there’s a <i>name</i>, <i>gender</i> and a <i>number</i> which represents how
many children were given that name. What’s a name? There’s many ways of answering that, but
to be quite boring, obvious, and technical, the names you find here are seemingly random
groupings of letters. How can you make a search query match something as unpredictable as&nbsp;that?</p>
<p>With <code>.</code></p>
<p>In Regex, a period matches any single alphanumeric character. But how can I match
multiple alphanumeric characters? Just tack on a <code>&#42;</code> symbol. The asterisk makes
a single Regex term match itself to multiple, concurrent characters. Hence, <code>.&#42;</code>
could match “Bob” just as well as it could match&nbsp;“Stephanie”.</p>
<p>With the above information, you can probably figure out how to find the gender initial. If
you guessed <code>.</code>, you’re&nbsp;correct!</p>
<p>Now for the last part, the number, we could actually stick with a simple <code>.&#42;</code>, but
there’s another way to do this. Within a set of <code>[]</code> square brackets, you can specify 
a set of alphanumeric values to match. Since the numbers can have integers anywhere from 0 to 9,
we can use <code>[0-9]&#42;</code> to match muliple concurrent integers. Sometimes it’s more
predictable and controllable when you specify the type of characters you are searching&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>Some of you have probably been wondering what to do with the commas. Good news! That’s easy.
All you need is a <code>,</code> (Regex is usually straightforward when it comes to matching
known characters and&nbsp;phrases)</p>
<p>Let’s put it all together. Remember, we need to intelligently find a name with a gender and&nbsp;number.</p>
<pre><code>.&#42;,.,[0-9]&#42;</code></pre>

<p>If you go to the Find window (there’s a tab for it at the top of the Replace window), you can plug
that in and hit “Find Next”. Doing this should result in a single entry being highlighted.&nbsp;Yay!</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;what?</p>
<p>If we’re going to actually do anything with the search results, we need to get fancier. All hail
the <code>()</code> parentheses! These give you the might and power of <i>variables</i>! If you’re
not swooning right now, you might not know what a variable is — if that’s the case, get thine butt to a basic
programming&nbsp;tutorial.</p>
<p>In Regex, when doing a replace, the term <code>$0</code> always represents the entire search result.
Let’s take for example a result when matching the query we just created.
If it was <code>Sophia,F,22158</code>, putting just <code>$0</code> in the “Replace with” field would
not change anything. <code>$0</code> would simply replace our search result with&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>Parentheses expand on this though and allows us to assign sections of the search result to variables.
This is very powerful. Let’s take the query we created earlier and add parentheses around the
Regex expressions for the <i>name</i>, <i>gender</i> and <i>number</i>.</p>
<pre><code>(.&#42;),(.),([0-9]&#42;)</code></pre>

<p>If you enter this into the “Find what” field and hit “Find next”, nothing will appear to have changed.
However, if you put <code>$1</code> in the “Replace with” field and hit “Replace All”, suddenly everything
but the names are gone. Undo that and try <code>$2</code>, then <code>$3</code>. This is where the magic
lies. Armed with knowledge of Regex variables, you just need to know a few more things to understand
the replace&nbsp;code:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\n</code> means “new line”. It’s what hitting your “Enter” key does in a word processor.
It’s not necessary, but it makes for prettier&nbsp;formatting.</li>
<li><code>\t</code> means “tab”. Again, not necessary, but indentation is&nbsp;prettierer.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all. Mix all of this together, and you get a “Replace with” entry as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<pre><code>{\n\t"name": "$1",\n\t"sex": "$2",\n\t"total": $3\n},</code></pre>

<p>This replaces the search result provided by <code>(.&#42;),(.),([0-9]&#42;)</code> with a <span class="caps">JSON</span> formatted
object. With a few seconds of work, you can create a two line solution to reformatting an entire data
set. Pretty&nbsp;cool!</p>
